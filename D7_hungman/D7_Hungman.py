If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses). \n \n As letters in the word are guessed, write them above the cooresponding underline. If a letter not in the word of guess, draw a picture of a person on the gallowâ€“one part for each incorrect letter guess. Most frequently, the person is drawn in 6 parts (for 6 letter guesses) in the order: head, body, left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm.\n" )
